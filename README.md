# ZARTA
Zarta's A Ruby Text Adventure
## How to run
The gem is now published on RubyGems.org. You can install and run it from there.

    $ gem install zarta
    $ zarta
Otherwise, if you want to clone it locally, use this command to run it. This will supress some annoying dependency warnings.

    $ ruby -W0 lib/zarta.rb
